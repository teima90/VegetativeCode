Hi everybody! My name is Maite, and I\'m a plant scientist. Originally from Spain, I\'ve been living in Belgium for several years now, where I am conducting my postdoctoral research at the Center for Plant Systems Biology (VIB-UGent).

I have a formal background in Biotechnology, with a specific focus on Plant Molecular Biology. A wet lab scientist. During my PhD at IFEVA in Buenos Aires (Argentina), I studied the role of BBX transcription factors in shade avoidance in *Arabidopsis thaliana*. But it didn't take long to realize that rather than study a function of a gene in a plant species, I wanted to understand how plants work in a larger scale.
I soon discovered that bioinformatics was key to exploring this.

At that time (around 2017), I had no coding skills, but I saw an opportunity to enroll in a Master's program in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics (UOC, distance learning) while finishing my PhD. Although I found the program\'s focus on statistics to be stronger than its bioinformatics content, one major benefit was that I had to use R in every lesson. I completed my Master's thesis on *Machine learning for the selection of genes involved in the development of Arabidopsis thaliana using gene expression data*. After that, I started to teach myself more programming in R. The best approach I found to improve my skills was to challenge myself to do everything in R---whether it was data analysis or visualizing results from my plant physiology experiments.

Thanks to this shift in my career I could get my current position, where I combine bioinformatics analysis with wet lab work, focusing on how root cell-type specific responses to biotic interactions have evolved across different plant species

With this blog, I would like to share some things that I have learnt and challenge myself to perform new analysis while documenting the process.
